            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            
            <p>These Terms and Conditions apply to the WOut app (hereby referred to as the <em>"Application"</em>) for mobile devices, created by Ricardo Hurla (hereby referred to as the <em>"Service Provider"</em>) as a free service.</p>
            
            <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these Terms. You are strongly advised to read them carefully before use. Unauthorised copying, modification, or distribution of the Application, or any part of it, including trademarks or intellectual property, is strictly prohibited. Attempting to extract the source code, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions is not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights relating to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>
            
            <p>The Service Provider is committed to keeping the Application as useful and efficient as possible. They reserve the right to modify the Application or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason, but any such changes will be clearly communicated.</p>
            
            <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you provide in order to deliver its functionality. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your device and your access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against <em>jailbreaking</em> or <em>rooting</em> your device, which involves removing software restrictions imposed by the operating system. Such actions may expose your device to malware, viruses, or security vulnerabilities, and could result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>
            
            <p>Please note that the Service Provider is not responsible for certain circumstances. Some features of the Application require an active internet connection, whether Wi-Fi or mobile data. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function fully due to lack of connectivity or data allowance.</p>
            
            <p>If you use the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile provider's terms still apply. You may incur data charges or roaming fees, and by using the Application, you accept responsibility for such costs. If you are not the bill payer for the device, it is assumed that you have obtained permission from the person responsible for the bill.</p>
            
            <p>Similarly, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged and operational. The Service Provider cannot be held liable if a lack of battery prevents you from using the Application.</p>
            
            <p>While the Service Provider aims to ensure that the Application is accurate and up to date, they rely on third parties for certain types of information. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that results from relying solely on this functionality.</p>
            
            <p>The Application may be updated from time to time. The Service Provider does not guarantee that updates will always be available, nor that the Application will remain compatible with your device or operating system. However, you agree to accept updates when offered. The Service Provider may also discontinue the Application at any time without prior notice. Upon termination, (a) the rights and licences granted to you in these Terms will end; (b) you must stop using the Application and delete it from your device.</p>

            <h2>Health and Safety Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>The WOut Application is designed for fitness tracking and workout guidance purposes only. It does <strong>not</strong> provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. You should always consult a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any exercise programme, especially if you have a medical condition, injury, or other health concern.</p>
            
            <p>By using the Application, you acknowledge and agree that your participation in any physical activity or workout is entirely at your own risk. The Service Provider and the Application shall not be held liable for any injury, health problem, or damage—whether direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential—that may result from the use or misuse of the workouts, recommendations, or information provided within the Application.</p>

            <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of updates by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
            
            <p>These Terms and Conditions are effective as of <strong>21 October 2025</strong>.</p>
