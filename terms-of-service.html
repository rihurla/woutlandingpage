            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            
            <p>These Terms and Conditions apply to the WOut app (hereby referred to as the <em>"Application"</em>) for mobile devices, created by Ricardo Hurla (hereby referred to as the <em>"Service Provider"</em>) as a free service.</p>
            
            <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these Terms. You are strongly advised to read them carefully before using the Application.</p>
            
            <p>Unauthorised copying, modification, or distribution of the Application, or any part of it, including trademarks or intellectual property, is strictly prohibited. Attempting to extract the source code, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions is not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights relating to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Service Use and Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider is committed to keeping the Application as useful and efficient as possible. They reserve the right to modify the Application or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason, but any such changes will always be clearly communicated.</p>
            
            <p>The Application stores and processes personal data provided by the user in order to deliver its features. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your device and access to the Application.</p>
            
            <p>The Service Provider strongly advises against <em>jailbreaking</em> or <em>rooting</em> your device, as this can compromise security, expose your device to malware, and cause the Application to malfunction.</p>
            
            <p><strong>TestFlight Beta Programme:</strong> If you are using a beta version of the Application distributed through Apple's TestFlight, please be aware that this is pre-release software that may contain bugs, incomplete features, or behave unexpectedly. The Application may crash or not function as intended. By participating in the beta testing programme, you acknowledge these risks and agree to provide feedback to help improve the Application. The Service Provider encourages beta testers to report any issues encountered during testing.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The Application uses third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. The Service Provider is not responsible for the content or practices of these third-party providers. You are encouraged to review their policies.</p>
            <ul style="color: #cccccc; margin-left: 2rem;">
                <li><a href="https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/" style="color: #007AFF;">TelemetryDeck</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/terms" style="color: #007AFF;">RevenueCat</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These third-party services may collect limited, anonymised data to provide functionality such as analytics and subscription management.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Internet Connection and Usage</h2>
            <p>Certain functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be via Wi-Fi or mobile network. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not operate at full capacity due to lack of connectivity or insufficient data allowance.</p>
            
            <p>If you use the Application outside a Wi-Fi area, your mobile provider’s terms may apply. You may incur data or roaming charges. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such costs. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the Application, it is assumed you have permission from the person responsible for the account.</p>
            
            <p>It is also your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged and functional. The Service Provider cannot be held liable if you are unable to access the Application due to device power or connectivity issues.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Health and Safety Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>The WOut Application is designed to assist users with fitness tracking and workout guidance. It does <strong>not</strong> provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>
            
            <p>You should always consult a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any exercise programme, particularly if you have any medical conditions, injuries, or other health concerns.</p>
            
            <p>By using the Application, you acknowledge and accept that your participation in any physical activity or workout is entirely at your own risk. The Service Provider and the Application shall not be held liable for any injury, health issue, or damage — whether direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential — that may arise from the use or misuse of the workouts, guidance, or information provided within the Application.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Updates and Availability</h2>
            <p>The Application may be updated periodically. The Service Provider does not guarantee that updates will always be available or that the Application will remain compatible with your device or operating system. However, you agree to accept updates when offered.</p>
            
            <p>The Service Provider may also discontinue the Application at any time without prior notice. Upon termination:</p>
            <ul style="color: #cccccc; margin-left: 2rem;">
                <li>(a) the rights and licences granted to you under these Terms will end; and</li>
                <li>(b) you must stop using the Application and delete it from your device.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>While the Service Provider strives to keep the Application up to date and reliable, no guarantees are made regarding accuracy or continuous availability. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, whether direct or indirect, resulting from your reliance on information or functionality provided by the Application.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. You are encouraged to review this page periodically for any updates. Any changes will take effect immediately upon being posted.</p>
            
            <p>These Terms and Conditions are effective as of <strong>9 November 2025</strong>.</p>
