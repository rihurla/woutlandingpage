            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the WOut app (hereby referred to as the <em>"Application"</em>) for mobile devices, created by Ricardo Hurla (hereby referred to as the <em>"Service Provider"</em>) as a free service. This service is provided <strong>"as is."</strong></p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>The Application collects and processes limited information to deliver its features. Specifically:</p>
            <ul style="color: #cccccc; margin-left: 2rem;">
                <li><strong>Health Data:</strong> The Application may access data from Apple Health (HealthKit), including workout data, active energy, weight, height, heart rate, and other metrics explicitly authorised by the user.</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud Data:</strong> The Application may use Apple's iCloud service to synchronise workout records and app data securely across your devices.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This data is accessed only after the user grants permission via Apple's Health permissions interface. The Service Provider does not collect, transmit, or store this data on external servers. All HealthKit and iCloud data remain under the user's control through Apple's systems.</p>
            
            <p>The Application does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
            <ul style="color: #cccccc; margin-left: 2rem;">
                <li>Collect or share precise location data.</li>
                <li>Track user activity for analytics or advertising.</li>
                <li>Require account creation or personal identifiers such as email or name.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The Service Provider may, at a later stage, introduce optional analytics to help improve the user experience. If this occurs, users will be notified and able to review updated privacy terms before such data collection begins.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider does <strong>not</strong> share or sell personal information to third parties.</p>
            
            <p>Aggregated or anonymised data may be used internally for performance improvements but is never associated with individual users. In rare cases, information may be disclosed:</p>
            <ul style="color: #cccccc; margin-left: 2rem;">
                <li>When required by law (e.g., to comply with a legal request).</li>
                <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of the Service Provider or others.</li>
                <li>To comply with Apple's platform policies where necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>User Control and Opt-Out Rights</h2>
            <p>You may stop all data collection by uninstalling the Application. You can manage permissions for Apple Health data at any time through <strong>Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices</strong> on your iOS device.</p>
            
            <p>Deleting the Application will remove all locally stored data. iCloud-synchronised data can be deleted manually via your Apple ID settings.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider retains user-provided data only while the Application remains installed and in use. Because all data is stored locally or through Apple iCloud, users can delete their information at any time by removing it from the Application or their iCloud account.</p>
            
            <p>If you have any requests regarding data deletion or access, please contact <strong>rihurladev@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Application is not directed at children under 13 years of age, and the Service Provider does not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>
            
            <p>If you believe that a child has provided personal information through the Application, please contact <strong>rihurladev@gmail.com</strong>, and the Service Provider will take steps to remove such data. In accordance with applicable law, users must generally be <strong>at least 16 years old</strong> to consent to data processing in their region.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider is committed to safeguarding your information. All HealthKit and iCloud data are protected by Apple's security infrastructure. The Application itself does not transmit data to external servers, reducing exposure to third-party risks.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. You are encouraged to review it from time to time for any changes. Updates will be posted on this page and take effect immediately upon publication.</p>
            
            <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of <strong>21 October 2025</strong>.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Your Consent</h2>
            <p>By using the Application, you consent to the collection and use of information as described in this Privacy Policy, and to any future amendments as posted.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, please contact the Service Provider at <strong>rihurladev@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
            
            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin: 2rem 0;">
            
            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #888; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">This Privacy Policy was originally generated using <a href="https://app-privacy-policy-generator.nisrulz.com/" style="color: #007AFF;">App Privacy Policy Generator</a> and has been adapted for accuracy, clarity, and British English usage.</p>
